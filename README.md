# css-animation-generator  
  
This code will generate a CSS keyframe for when you want to move an HTML element around in a circle, triangle, square, etc.  

> script.js
```js
const kframe = new CSSKeyframeGen("aniOne", 20, 16, 0, 0, 1);

console.log(kframe.keyframe); //Prints the generated keyframe
console.log(kframe.coords); //Prints out the coordinations for every point of the path relative from its current position in pixels;
kframe.write(); //Appends the keyframe to the head tag
```
> style.css
```css
element{
  animation: 1s ease aniOne infinite;
}
```
